## Tests

To start testing, make sure the devDependency **Jest** is installed by running `npm i`.

Start by running `npm test` for Jest testing.

The tests start by ensuring any missing arguments successfully throw errors.
Next, tests are done to ensure that new classes are successfully created.
Finally, when the logo is generated tests are made to ensure the correct attributes are applied to the newly created logo.
